# Accessibility Check in UI Design for Figma

This Figma plugin was developed as part of my **Final Year Project** for the **BSc Computer Science** degree at the **University of Birmingham**. The project focuses on improving **accessibility in UI design** by helping designers identify and resolve common accessibility issues during the design phase.

The plugin offers a user-friendly way to evaluate Figma designs against established accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG), with features tailored for designers and developers aiming to create inclusive digital experiences.
